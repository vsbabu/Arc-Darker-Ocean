# Arc-Darker-Ocean

Copy of Arc-Darker (https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) theme in ~/.themes/, with white background changed to light gray/blue. Easy on eyes.

I am not a themer. On Linux Mint 17.3, ran into problems to compile Arc theme from git. Here is how this was packaged.

1. Downloaded Arc deb file for 15.04.
2. Extracted it locally.
3. Copied all Arc-* directories to ~/.themes/
4. Deleted `dotted` style from all css since it is doesn't come up nicely in LM 17.3, which is derived from Ubuntu 14.04.
5. Now copied Arc-Darker to Arc-Darker-Ocean
6. Replaced some background colors from white to lighter gray.

Thanks to horst3180 for a nice and pleasant theme. 

This is just a backup for me :) Someday when I figure out how to change the base theme and build with different colorschemes, will fork from original depot.
